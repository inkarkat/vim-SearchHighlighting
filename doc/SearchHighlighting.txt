DESCRIPTION				      *SearchHighlighting-description*

This plugin changes the |star| command *, so that it doesn't jump to the next
match. (Unless you supply a [count], so 1* now restores the old * behavior.)
If you issue a |star| command on the same text as before, the search
highlighting is turned off (via |:nohlsearch|); the search pattern remains
set, so a |n| / |N| command will turn highlighting on again. With this, you
can easily toggle highlighting for the current word / visual selection.

With the disabling of the jump to the next match, there is no difference
between * and # any more, so the # key can now be used for some other mapping.

This plugin also extends the |star| command to visual mode, where instead of
the current word, the selected text is used as the literal search pattern.

The auto-search functionality instantly highlights the word under the cursor
when typing or moving around. This can be helpful while browsing source code;
whenever you position the cursor on an identifier, all other occurrences are
instantly highlighted. This functionality is toggled on/off via <Leader>*. You
can also |:nohlsearch| to temporarily disable the highlighting.

SEE ALSO								     *

- mark.vim (vimscript #2666) can highlight several patterns in different
  colors simultaneously.
- SearchAlternatives.vim (vimscript #4146) can add and subtract search
  alternatives via mappings and commands.
- To also show the number of matches when selecting a word (|*|, |g*| etc.),
  you can append the corresponding command to the <Plug> mapping (see
  |SearchHighlighting-remap|): >
    nmap <silent> * <Plug>SearchHighlightingStar:%s///gn<CR>
< The |SearchPosition.vim| plugin (vimscript #2634) provides an extended
  version of that command.

RELATED WORKS								     *

I came up with this on my own; however, the idea can be traced back to
francoissteinmetz and da.thompson in the comments of vimtip #1 (now at
http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/VimTip1): >
    map <silent> <F10> :set invhls<CR>:let @/="<C-r><C-w>"<CR>
<
- highlight_word_under_cursor.vim (vimscript #4287) implements the search
  auto-highlighting of the whole and optionally current word.
- HiCursorWords (vimscript #4306) highlights the word under the cursor, with
  optional delay and limited to certain syntax groups.
- Matchmaker (https://github.com/qstrahl/vim-matchmaker) highlights the word
  under the cursor with matchadd(), not the current search pattern.
- star search (vimscript #4335) changes the behavior of * to not jump to the
  next match, and includes the visual search from the next plugin
- https://github.com/bronson/vim-visual-star-search provides searching of the
  visual selection
- visualstar.vim (vimscript #2944) provides searching of the visual selection
- select & search (vimscript #4819) can use either n/N or * in the visual
  selection, and (like this plugin) can avoid jumping.
- vim-cursorword (vimscript #5100) automatically underlines the current word
  in the current window (like :SearchAutoHighlighting), but uses :match
  instead of search
- vim-asterisk (vimscript #5059) is quite similar, providing a z* mapping that
  also doesn't jump, visual *, more intuitive smartcase handling, and can keep
  the cursor position when jumping (like ,*)
- searchant.vim (vimscript #5404) hooks into the built-in search commands and
  provides a separate highlighting for the match last jumped to.

==============================================================================
USAGE						    *SearchHighlighting-usage*

*			Toggle search highlighting for the current whole
			\<word\> on/off.
g*			Toggle search highlighting for the current word
			on/off.
								      *v_star*
{Visual}*		Toggle search highlighting for the selection on/off.
			For a |blockwise-visual| selection, not just lines
			that match the block's lines on their own are matched,
			but all occurrences that contain the block's text,
			though not just with the same vertical alignment (that
			isn't possible to assert with Vim's regular
			expressions), and only the first line's match is
			highlighted. For example, a match on
			    foo ~
			    bar ~
			will also match all three occurrences in
			    foo    my foo is        tell foo ~
			    bar    inside bar		    bar ~
			but not a single
			    foo ~

[count]*		Search forward for the [count]'th occurrence of the
[count]g*		word nearest to the cursor.
{Visual}[count]*

							     *ALT-8* *g_ALT-8*
ALT-8			Toggle search highlighting for the current whole
			\_sWORD\_s on/off. With [count]: Search forward for the
			[count]'th occurrence.
g_ALT-8			Toggle search highlighting for the current WORD
			on/off. With [count]: Search forward for the
			[count]'th occurrence.
					 *,star* *,g_star* *,ALT-8* *,g_ALT-8*
[count],*		Search forward for the [count]'th occurrence of the
			word under the cursor, keeping the cursor at the
			current position within the word's matches (via
			|search-offset|).
			Observes the new non-jumping behavior of the star
			commands without a [count].
[count],g*		Like above: variants of the searches that keep the
,_ALT-8			cursor at the current relative match position.
,g_ALT-8		Note that if you have set |mapleader| to ",", some of
			these would conflict with other plugin mappings; you
			have to define|SearchHighlighting-configuration|
			yourself.
								     *,n* *,N*
[count],n		Repeat the latest "/" search [count] times, keeping
			the cursor at the current position relative to the end
			of the current match (via |search-offset|).
			Like |,star|, but reuses the last search pattern
			instead of searching for the word under the cursor.
			As such, the cursor can also be outside a match (but
			still within the same line), and a corresponding
			offset (the smallest possible if there are several
			nearby matches) is chosen.
[count],N		Repeat the latest "?" search [count] times, keeping
			the cursor at the current position relative to the
			start of the current match (via |search-offset|).
			Note: To avoid another set of mappings, the search
			direction and offset anchor (start or end of match)
			are combined here. The search direction can easily be
			reverted via |n|/|N|, anyway.

					       *<Leader>star* *v_<Leader>star*
<Leader>*		Toggle auto-search highlighting (using the last
			{what}; default is "wword").
{Visual}<Leader>*	Toggle auto-search highlighting; when turning on, a
			{what} value of "selection" is used (but the preset
			isn't changed; the original value is used for a later
			non-visual mode auto-search).
						     *:SearchAutoHighlighting*
:SearchAutoHighlighting [{what}]
			Turn on automatic highlighting of occurrences of
			{what} in normal mode, and the selected text in visual
			/ select mode. Possible values:
			wword: whole |cword|, like |star|; this is the default
			wWORD: whole |cWORD|, delimited by whitespace
			cword: current word under cursor
			cWORD: current WORD under cursor
			line:  current text in line, excluding indent and
			       trailing whitespace
			exactline:  exact current line
			from-cursor:only consider the text from the beginning
				    of the line up to the cursor; ignore text
				    before the cursor
			to-cursor:  only consider the text from the cursor to
				    the end of the line
			selection:  only highlight selected text, in normal
				    mode, nothing is selected
			*-iw:	    allow for variations in whitespace (also
				    newline characters, i.e. allow a match
				    distributed over multiple lines), and
				    ignore any comment prefixes (e.g. /*, #),
				    too.
			*-nw:	    allow for variations in whitespace and also
				    direct concatenation of lines (i.e. without
				    any whitespace in between)

						   *:NoSearchAutoHighlighting*
:NoSearchAutoHighlighting[!]
			Turn off automatic highlighting. With [!], also turn
			off all tab page- and window-local ones.

	   *:SearchAutoHighlightingWinLocal* *:SearchAutoHighlightingTabLocal*
:SearchAutoHighlightingWinLocal [{what}]
:SearchAutoHighlightingTabLocal [{what}]
			Like |:SearchAutoHighlighting|, but limit the effect
			to the current window / tab page. Different {what}
			occurrences can be configured for each instance.
       *:NoSearchAutoHighlightingWinLocal* *:NoSearchAutoHighlightingTabLocal*
:NoSearchAutoHighlightingWinLocal[!]
:NoSearchAutoHighlightingTabLocal[!]
			Like |:NoSearchAutoHighlighting|, but only for the
			current window / tab page. With [!], it explicitly
			turns off Auto Search (even if a higher scope still
			has it active), without it, it will still consider the
			higher scopes.

==============================================================================
INSTALLATION				     *SearchHighlighting-installation*

The code is hosted in a Git repo at
    https://github.com/inkarkat/vim-SearchHighlighting
You can use your favorite plugin manager, or "git clone" into a directory used
for Vim |packages|. Releases are on the "stable" branch, the latest unstable
development snapshot on "master".

This script is also packaged as a |vimball|. If you have the "gunzip"
decompressor in your PATH, simply edit the *.vmb.gz package in Vim; otherwise,
decompress the archive first, e.g. using WinZip. Inside Vim, install by
sourcing the vimball or via the |:UseVimball| command. >
    vim SearchHighlighting*.vmb.gz
    :so %
To uninstall, use the |:RmVimball| command.

DEPENDENCIES				     *SearchHighlighting-dependencies*

- Requires Vim 7.0 or higher.
- Requires the |ingo-library.vim| plugin (vimscript #4433), version 1.040 or
  higher.

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION				    *SearchHighlighting-configuration*
						    *SearchHighlighting-remap*
If you want to use different mappings, map your keys to the
<Plug>SearchHighlighting... mapping targets _before_ sourcing the script (e.g.
in your |vimrc|): >
    nmap <Leader>&   <Plug>SearchHighlightingWORD
    nmap <Leader>&&  <Plug>SearchHighlightingGWORD
    nmap <Leader>*.  <Plug>SearchHighlightingCStar
    nmap <Leader>**. <Plug>SearchHighlightingCGStar
    nmap <Leader>&.  <Plug>SearchHighlightingCWORD
    nmap <Leader>&&. <Plug>SearchHighlightingCGWORD
    nmap <Leader>**  <Plug>SearchHighlightingAutoSearch
<
If you do not want the new non-jumping behavior of the star commands at all: >
    let g:SearchHighlighting_NoJump = 0
    let g:SearchHighlighting_ExtendStandardCommands = 1
<
If you want the new non-jumping behavior, but map it to different keys: >
    let g:SearchHighlighting_ExtendStandardCommands = 1
    nmap <Leader>*  <Plug>SearchHighlightingStar
    nmap <Leader>g* <Plug>SearchHighlightingGStar
    vmap <Leader>*  <Plug>SearchHighlightingStar
<
If you want a mapping to turn off hlsearch, use this: >
    nmap <A-/> <Plug>SearchHighlightingNohlsearch
    vmap <A-/> <Plug>SearchHighlightingNohlsearch
<
To toggle hlsearch (temporarily, so that a new search or |n| command will
automatically re-enable it), use: >
    nmap <F12> <Plug>SearchHighlightingToggleHlsearch
    vmap <F12> <Plug>SearchHighlightingToggleHlsearch
<

==============================================================================
HISTORY						  *SearchHighlighting-history*

2.10	31-Oct-2019
- ENH: Add ,n and ,N variants of ,* that reuse the last search pattern, and
  therefore also allow offsets outside of the match itself.
  *** You need to update to ingo-library (vimscript #4433) version 1.040! ***

2.01	11-Jul-2019
- ENH: Add ...-iw / ...-nw variants of exactline, line, selection that match
  ignoring whitespace differences / and no whitespace.
- Trigger LastSearchPatternChanged User event to notify other plugins (e.g. my
  SearchRepeat.vim plugin (vimscript #4949)) of the change of register /.
- :SearchAutoHighlighting commands inform the SearchRepeat.vim plugin that the
  change in register / is automatic, not initiated by the user, so that the
  current custom search is kept active instead of reverting back to standard
  search.
- ENH: Add from-cursor and to-cursor (and -iw, -nw variants) for
  :SearchAutoHighlighting.
  *** You need to update to ingo-library (vimscript #4433) version 1.036! ***

2.00	27-Jan-2017
- ENH: Allow tab page- and window-local Auto Search Highlighting via new
  :SearchAutoHighlightingTabLocal, :SearchAutoHighlightingWinLocal commands.
- ENH: Support v:hlsearch (available since Vim 7.4.079) via an alternative set
  of functions that don't use the s:isSearchOn internal flag.
- BUG: Handle "No string under cursor" for ,* mapping correctly by returing
  the :echoerr call, not 0.
- BUG: Off-by-one in ,* on second-to-last character.
- ENH: <A-8>, g<A-8> mappings star-like search for [whole] cWORD (instead of
  cword).
- Generalize the ,* mapping to support all four variants of the * mapping
  (whole / current, cword, cWORD), too.
- Only define default ,* etc. mappings when the map leader isn't set to ",",
  which would make it conflict with the <Leader>* Auto-Search mapping. Thanks
  to Ilya Tumaykin for raising this issue.
- Don't show strange whitespace matches on ":SearchAutoHighlighting wWORD"
  caused by empty \%(^\|\s\)\zs\ze\%(\s\|$\) pattern. Set completely empty
  pattern then.
- Re-enable search highlighting when switching to a window that has Auto
  Search. Clear search highlighting when switching from a window that has Auto
  Search to one that hasn't, and search highlighting was previously turned
  off.
- Save and restore the Auto Search pattern from a selection source when
  updating.
  *** You need to update to ingo-library (vimscript #4433) version 1.023! ***

1.22	19-Jun-2014
- Add <Leader>* visual mode mapping that turns on auto-search only for
  selected text (without affecting the original {what} default).
- Add "selection" value for {what} in :SearchHighlightingAutoSearch that only
  highlights selected text.

1.21	23-May-2014
- Also abort on :SearchAutoHighlighting error.
- Remove duplicate /.*.*/ in pattern for visual blockwise search.

1.20	29-Nov-2013
- ENH: Add ,* search that keeps the current position within the current word
  when jumping to subsequent matches.
- Correctly emulate * behavior on whitespace-only lines where there's no
  cword: Issue "E348: No string under cursor".
- Add dependency to ingo-library (vimscript #4433). *** You need to separately
  install ingo-library (vimscript #4433) version 1.015 (or higher)! ***

1.10	19-Jan-2013 (unreleased)
- For a blockwise visual selection, don't just match the block's lines on
  their own, but also when contained in other text.
- BUG: For {Visual}*, a [count] isn't considered.

1.02	17-Jan-2013
Do not trigger modeline processing when enabling auto-search highlighting.

1.01	03-Dec-2012
FIX: Prevent repeated error message when an invalid {what} was given to
:SearchAutoHighlighting.

1.00	23-Nov-2012
First published version.

0.01	06-Jun-2008
Started development.
