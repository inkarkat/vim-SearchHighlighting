DESCRIPTION				       *SearchHighlighting-description*

This plugin changes the |star| command '*', so that it doesn't jump to the
next match. (Unless you supply a [count], so '1*' now restores the old '*'
behavior.) If you issue a star command on the same text as before, the search
highlighting is turned off (via :nohlsearch); the search pattern remains set,
so a 'n' / 'N' command will turn highlighting on again. With this, you can
easily toggle highlighting for the current word / visual selection.

With the disabling of the jump to the next match, there is no difference
between * and # any more, so the # key can now be used for some other mapping.

This plugin also extends the |star| command to visual mode, where instead of
the current word, the selected text is used as the literal search pattern.

The auto-search functionality instantly highlights the word under the cursor
when typing or moving around. This can be helpful while browsing source code;
whenever you position the cursor on an identifier, all other occurrences are
instantly highlighted. This functionality is toggled on/off via <Leader>*. You
can also :nohlsearch to temporarily disable the highlighting.

RELATED WORKS								     *

I came up with this on my own; however, the idea can be traced back to
francoissteinmetz@yahoo.fr and da.thompson@yahoo.com in vimtip #1: >
    map <silent> <F10> :set invhls<CR>:let @/="<C-r><C-w>"<CR>

==============================================================================

INSTALLATION				      *SearchHighlighting-installation*

This script is packaged as a |vimball|. If you have the "gunzip" decompressor
in your PATH, simply edit the *.vba.gz package in Vim; otherwise, decompress
the archive first, e.g. using WinZip. Inside Vim, install by sourcing the
vimball or via the |:UseVimball| command. >
    vim SearchHighlighting.vba.gz
    :so %
To uninstall, use the |:RmVimball| command.

DEPENDENCIES				      *SearchHighlighting-dependencies*

- Requires Vim 7.0 or higher.

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION				     *SearchHighlighting-configuration*

If you do not want the new non-jumping behavior of the star commands at all: >
    let g:SearchHighlighting_NoJump = 0
    let g:SearchHighlighting_ExtendStandardCommands = 1
<
If you want the new non-jumping behavior, but map it to different keys: >
    let g:SearchHighlighting_ExtendStandardCommands = 1
    nmap <Leader>*  <Plug>SearchHighlightingStar
    nmap <Leader>g* <Plug>SearchHighlightingGStar
    vmap <Leader>*  <Plug>SearchHighlightingStar
<
If you want a mapping to turn off hlsearch, use this: >
    nmap <A-/> <Plug>SearchHighlightingNohlsearch
    vmap <A-/> <Plug>SearchHighlightingNohlsearch
<
To toggle hlsearch (temporarily, so that a new search or 'n' command will
automatically re-enable it), use: >
    nmap <F12> <Plug>SearchHighlightingToggleHlsearch
    vmap <F12> <Plug>SearchHighlightingToggleHlsearch
<
